# Layering with Aseprite

I use the tool [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/){:target="_blank"} for drawing and animating pixel art / sprite work. A common feature amongst most drawing programs is to allow separating parts of the drawing onto several separate layers. This can be an important feature for artists, as it allows easier tracking and adjusting of different sections of their art.
