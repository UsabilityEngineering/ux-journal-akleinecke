# Austin's UX Portfolio

I am a Computer Science major at Chico State University!

I decided to take this course as UX design has always interested me, and the course was a Pathways requirement. ;)

In addition to writing code, I enjoy brewing beer, snowboarding, and drawing!

I look forward to learning more about UX design!
